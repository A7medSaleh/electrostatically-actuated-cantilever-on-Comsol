The elastic cantilever beam is one of the elementary structures used in MEMS designs. This model shows the bending of a cantilever beam under an applied electrostatic load. The model solves the deformation of the beam under an applied voltage.

In this model I make an accurate modeling for electrostatically actuated cantilever on Comsol to study its behavior.
